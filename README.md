# Fund Manager: an automated portfolio analyzer that records historical address-level data and receives incoming transactions

**fundManager is compatible with bitcoin addresses only.**

## Context

I started wondering what would happen if I create a savings account denominated in bitcoin. The idea is very simple. Exchange X amount of my income (canadian dollars) every week for bitcoin.

I wanted a different experience from my already rigurous investment practices in bitcoin. And while it is practically the same thing, at least this "savings account" can be made public so that I can share the data collected with my fellow middle-class workers.

It feels like a great time to be middle-class. When it comes to my socio-economic position, I have nothing to lose, therefore I feel comfortable assuming this "risk".

Btw, around Y2, I realized that I want to rebrand from "savings account" to "bitcoin fund", and I will be referring to the address as a fund.

## Fund Parameters: normative principles from Tradfi investing

I am not trying to re-invent the wheel, so I have set strict parameters for the fund:

1. **Long-term holding:** the fund will remain active for a minimum of 10-years, and the commitment to never sell the Bitcoin held at the fund, even beyond active status.
2. **DCA:** the fund does not aim to time the market, therefore the purchase strategy is simple: buy on a weekly basis and/or when I come across extra cash. The weekly purchases are recommended, but not set in stone. However, the fund should always purchase a minimum of $13,000 CAD worth of bitcoin on a yearly basis.
3. **Do not speculate, just hold and be patient:** related to timing the market again, but it is important this point is clear. The fund will not participate in the trading of Bitcoin, it will only accumulate.
